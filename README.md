# Visual Cryptography Authentication System

## Project Overview
This project is centered on a **User Authentication System** that leverages **Visual Cryptography** and the **AES Algorithm** to provide a secure, user-friendly method for authenticating users. The system enhances security by dividing images into transparent shares, which must be combined to reveal sensitive information for user authentication.

### Key Features:
- **Visual Cryptography**: Transparent shares ensure secure authentication.
- **AES Algorithm**: Provides robust encryption for images and secret keys.
- **User Authentication**: Simplified and secure user access to systems and services.
- **Applications**: Used in banking, secure document handling, airline booking systems, and more.

---

## Motivation
The project aims to:
- Enhance security through **multi-factor authentication**.
- Provide a **user-friendly alternative** to traditional password systems.
- Ensure data remains confidential, even during unauthorized access attempts.
- Offer resistance against brute-force and human attacks.

---

## Project Modules
The system comprises the following modules:
1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - Registration Page: Upload an image and set a secret key (encrypted using AES).
   - Login Page: Validate username and password.
   - Encrypted Image Upload: Decrypt an image using the secret key and proceed to OTP verification.
2. **OTP Validation**: Sends an OTP to the registered email for added security.
3. **Database Connectivity**: Ensures seamless storage and retrieval of user credentials.

## Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or 10
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Hardware**: Standard Windows Keyboard, 8GB RAM

---

## Advantages
- Easy to implement and understand.
- No specialized software/hardware required.
- Resistant to brute-force and human-access attacks.
- Applicable across various fields such as **secure voting systems** and **secret data sharing**.

## Limitations
- Low embedding capacity for hidden information.
- Requires precise alignment of shares.
- Sensitive to noise and degradation.

## Code Availability
The repository includes the code for the following pages:
1. **Main GUI Page**
2. **Registration Page**
3. **Login Page**
